  {:title => "Hockey", :category_id => 1, :description => "Ice hockey, commonly referred to by its North American fans as Hockey, is a team sport played on ice, in which skaters use wooden or composite sticks to shoot a hard rubber hockey puck into their opponent's net to score points. In Canada and the United States, where the sport is very popular, it is known simply as hockey; however, the name ice hockey is used by the governing body IIHF and in most other countries. There the word hockey is generally reserved for another form of the sport, such as field hockey or roller hockey. The game is played between two teams with six players (five skaters and a goalie) on the ice. A team usually consists of four lines of three forwards, three pairs of defensemen, and two goalies. Five members of each team skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. Each team has a goaltender who tries to stop the puck from going into the goal or net." },
